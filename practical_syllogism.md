# Aristotle’s Practical Syllogism Builder  
## (Teleological and Operational Version with Defined Necessity)

You are to apply Aristotle’s regressive practical syllogism method to a goal.

This method treats the goal as a **final cause** — that for the sake of which action is undertaken.  
The end is first in intention and last in execution.  
It determines the means.

---

# PHASE 0 — DETERMINE THE END (If Indeterminate)

If the goal is vague (e.g., “focus more,” “be healthier,” “be productive”):

## Step 0.1 — Clarify the Good
Ask:
- What observable behavior would indicate success?
- For how long?
- In what context?
- Compared to what baseline?
- Why is this desirable to me?

The goal must genuinely attract you as good.  
If it does not move you to act, refine it.

## Step 0.2 — Convert to Measurable Form

Rewrite as:

**G = [observable, time-bound, measurable outcome]**

Do not proceed until G is concrete and behaviorally expressible.

---

# PHASE 1 — IDENTIFY THE TYPE OF END

Determine whether the goal is:

- **Proximate** (immediate result),
- **Intermediate** (for the sake of something further),
- **Ultimate** (for its own sake).

If intermediate, briefly identify the higher end it serves.

This ensures you are building the chain at the correct level.

---

# PHASE 2 — REGRESS FROM THE END

Repeatedly ask:

> If there is to be G, what must first be true?

For each answer:

1. Identify a condition **necessary by necessity of means**.
2. Label it (B₁, B₂, B₃, etc.).
3. Express it conditionally:

   If G → B₁  
   If B₁ → B₂  
   If B₂ → B₃  

### Definition of Necessity (For This Method)

A condition is necessary **by necessity of means** if:

- Without it, the end cannot occur.
- If the end is to be achieved, this must be present.
- Removing it prevents the end.

This is **conditional (hypothetical) necessity**, not:
- Absolute metaphysical necessity,
- Logical necessity,
- Or necessity imposed by rule or authority.

Each condition must be necessary specifically **for the sake of this end**, not merely helpful in general.

Continue regressing.

# PHASE 3 — STOP AT THE FIRST VOLUNTARY ACT

Stop when you reach:

- A physically performable action.
- Something under direct control.
- Something executable immediately.
- No prior condition blocks it.

Label this:

**A = [first voluntary act]**

The first act must require no further decision.

---

# PHASE 4 — STATE THE PRACTICAL SYLLOGISM

Write the full chain:

1. I will [G].
2. To achieve G, B₁ must be present.
3. To have B₁, B₂ must be present.
4. To have B₂, B₃ must be present.
5. Therefore: perform A.

The conclusion must be an action, not a proposition.

---

# PHASE 5 — FORWARD EXECUTION PLAN

List the forward order of execution:

A → B₃ → B₂ → B₁ → G

Write each as a clear behavioral instruction.

---

# RULES

- The end is first in intention, last in execution.
- The end determines the means.
- Necessity here is conditional necessity of means.
- Do not regress from a vague goal.
- Do not stop at abstractions.
- Do not stop at mental states alone.
- Stop only at executable action.
- The conclusion must move the body.
