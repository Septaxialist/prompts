# Aristotelian Practical Syllogism Builder  

You are to apply Aristotle’s regressive practical syllogism method to a goal.

This method treats the goal as a **final cause** — that for the sake of which action is undertaken.  
The end is first in intention and last in execution.  
It determines the means.

In most practical matters:

- Necessity is **relative necessity of means**, not absolute.
- Multiple sufficient realizations may exist (branching).
- Some factors are **causes**, others are merely **conditions**.

You must distinguish these carefully.

---

# PHASE 0 — DETERMINE THE END (If Indeterminate)

If the goal is vague (e.g., “focus more,” “be healthier,” “be productive”):

## Step 0.1 — Clarify the Good
Ask:
- What observable behavior would indicate success?
- For how long?
- In what context?
- Compared to what baseline?
- Why is this desirable to me?

The goal must genuinely attract you as good.  
If it does not move you to act, refine it.

## Step 0.2 — Convert to Measurable Form

Rewrite as:

**G = [observable, time-bound, measurable outcome]**

Do not proceed until G is concrete and behaviorally expressible.

---

# PHASE 1 — IDENTIFY THE TYPE OF END

Determine whether the goal is:

- **Proximate** (immediate result),
- **Intermediate** (for the sake of something further),
- **Ultimate** (for its own sake).

If intermediate, briefly identify the higher end it serves.

---

# PHASE 2 — IDENTIFY NECESSARY ELEMENTS (THE TRUNK)

Ask:

> If there is to be G, what must be true?

Identify elements necessary **by necessity of means**.

### Definition of Necessity (For This Method)

A condition is necessary by necessity of means if:

- Without it, the end cannot occur (under intended conditions).
- If the end is to be achieved, it must be present.
- Removing it prevents the end.

This is **conditional (hypothetical) necessity**, not:
- Absolute metaphysical necessity,
- Logical necessity,
- Necessity imposed by rule.

---

## Distinguish Causes and Conditions

For each necessary element, classify it as:

### 1. Cause (properly so called)

If it positively contributes to producing the end, identify which kind:

- **Final cause** – the end for the sake of which.
- **Efficient cause** – the action that brings it about.
- **Material cause** – the substrate or resources required.
- **Formal cause** – the structure, organization, or pattern required.

### 2. Condition

If it does not produce the end but must be present (e.g., absence of impediment, background enabling factor), classify it as a **condition**.

Example distinctions:
- Sleep → material cause
- Structured routine → formal cause
- Nightly prep → efficient cause
- No late caffeine → condition (removal of impediment)

Label trunk necessities:

G → B₁ (formal cause)  
G → B₂ (material cause)  
G → B₃ (efficient cause)  
G → B₄ (condition)

---

# PHASE 3 — IDENTIFY BRANCHING REALIZATIONS (SPECIES)

For each trunk element (B₁, B₂, etc.), ask:

> In what ways can this be realized?

Because necessity is often **relative**, substitution may be possible.

For each B₁:

B₁ → (C₁ ∨ C₂ ∨ C₃)

Each Cᵢ is a sufficient realization of B₁.

Branch only when:
- Substitution is possible,
- Multiple sufficient routes exist,
- The necessity is relative, not absolute.

---

# PHASE 4 — REGRESS WITHIN A CHOSEN BRANCH

Select one branch (C₁, C₂, etc.) and regress:

If C₁ → D₁  
If D₁ → E₁  
If E₁ → A  

Continue until reaching:

- A physically performable action,
- Under direct control,
- Executable immediately,
- Requiring no further decision.

Label:

**A = [first voluntary act]**

---

# PHASE 5 — STATE THE PRACTICAL SYLLOGISM

Write:

1. I will [G].
2. To achieve G, B₁ (and other trunk causes/conditions) must be present.
3. To realize B₁, I will use C₁.
4. To realize C₁, D₁ must occur.
5. Therefore: perform A.

The conclusion must be an action.

---

# PHASE 6 — FORWARD EXECUTION PLAN

Trace forward from A:

A → … → C₁ → B₁ → G

Write each as a clear behavioral instruction.

---

# STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES

- The end (final cause) governs the structure.
- Efficient causes produce motion.
- Material causes supply substrate.
- Formal causes structure the activity.
- Conditions remove impediments.
- Trunk elements are necessary by relative necessity of means.
- Branches represent alternative sufficient realizations.
- Absolute necessity yields linear chains.
- Relative necessity yields branching trees.
- Stop regression only at executable action.
- The conclusion must move the body.

If the end is to be achieved, the necessary causes must operate and the required conditions must hold.  
If the necessity is relative, multiple branches may satisfy it.  
Motion begins when one branch is chosen and the first act is performed.
