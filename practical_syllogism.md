# Aristotle’s Practical Syllogism Builder  
## (Teleological, Branching, and Operational Version with Defined Necessity)

You are to apply Aristotle’s regressive practical syllogism method to a goal.

This method treats the goal as a **final cause** — that for the sake of which action is undertaken.  
The end is first in intention and last in execution.  
It determines the means.

In most practical matters, necessity is **relative necessity of means**, not absolute.  
Therefore, branching structures may be required.

---

# PHASE 0 — DETERMINE THE END (If Indeterminate)

If the goal is vague (e.g., “focus more,” “be healthier,” “be productive”):

## Step 0.1 — Clarify the Good
Ask:
- What observable behavior would indicate success?
- For how long?
- In what context?
- Compared to what baseline?
- Why is this desirable to me?

The goal must genuinely attract you as good.  
If it does not move you to act, refine it.

## Step 0.2 — Convert to Measurable Form

Rewrite as:

**G = [observable, time-bound, measurable outcome]**

Do not proceed until G is concrete and behaviorally expressible.

---

# PHASE 1 — IDENTIFY THE TYPE OF END

Determine whether the goal is:

- **Proximate** (immediate result),
- **Intermediate** (for the sake of something further),
- **Ultimate** (for its own sake).

If intermediate, briefly identify the higher end it serves.

This ensures you are building the chain at the correct level.

---

# PHASE 2 — IDENTIFY NECESSARY CONDITIONS (THE TRUNK)

Ask:

> If there is to be G, what must be true?

Identify conditions necessary **by necessity of means**.

### Definition of Necessity (For This Method)

A condition is necessary by necessity of means if:

- Without it, the end cannot occur (under intended conditions).
- If the end is to be achieved, this must be present.
- Removing it prevents the end.

This is **conditional (hypothetical) necessity**, not:
- Absolute metaphysical necessity,
- Logical necessity,
- Or necessity imposed by rule.

Label these trunk conditions:

G → B₁  
G → B₂  
G → B₃  

These are high-level necessities (genera).

---

# PHASE 3 — IDENTIFY BRANCHING REALIZATIONS (SPECIES)

For each necessary trunk condition (B₁, B₂, etc.), ask:

> In what ways can this be realized?

Because most practical necessities are **relative**, they may admit multiple sufficient realizations.

For each B₁:

B₁ → (C₁ ∨ C₂ ∨ C₃)

Each Cᵢ is a sufficient realization of B₁.

Example structure:

G → B₁  
B₁ → (C₁ ∨ C₂)  

C₁ → D₁ → A₁  
C₂ → D₂ → A₂  

Branch only when:
- Substitution is possible.
- Multiple sufficient routes exist.
- The necessity is relative, not absolute.

---

# PHASE 4 — REGRESS WITHIN A CHOSEN BRANCH

Select one branch (C₁, C₂, etc.) and regress:

If C₁ → D₁  
If D₁ → E₁  
If E₁ → A₁  

Continue until reaching:

- A physically performable action,
- Under direct control,
- Executable immediately,
- Requiring no further decision.

Label this:

**A = [first voluntary act in chosen branch]**

---

# PHASE 5 — STATE THE PRACTICAL SYLLOGISM

Write:

1. I will [G].
2. To achieve G, B₁ (and other trunk conditions) must be present.
3. To realize B₁, I will use C₁.
4. To realize C₁, D₁ must occur.
5. Therefore: perform A.

The conclusion must be an action.

---

# PHASE 6 — FORWARD EXECUTION PLAN

Trace forward from the chosen A:

A → … → C₁ → B₁ → G

Write each as a clear behavioral instruction.

---

# STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES

- The end governs the entire structure.
- Trunk conditions = necessary by relative necessity of means.
- Branches = alternative sufficient realizations.
- Absolute necessity yields linear chains.
- Relative necessity yields branching trees.
- Stop regression only at executable action.
- The conclusion must move the body.

[State the goal exactly as originally given.]

## Clarified Goal
G = ...

## Type of End
(Proximate / Intermediate / Ultimate)

## Necessary Trunk Conditions
G → B₁  
G → B₂  
...

## Branching Realizations
B₁ → (C₁ ∨ C₂ ∨ ...)  
B₂ → (D₁ ∨ D₂ ∨ ...)

## Chosen Branch and Regression
If C₁ → E₁  
If E₁ → F₁  
...

## First Voluntary Act
A = ...

## Practical Conclusion
Therefore: ...

## Forward Execution Plan
1. ...

If the end is to be achieved, the necessary trunk conditions must be present.  
If the necessity is relative, multiple branches may satisfy it.  
Motion begins when one branch is chosen and the first act is performed.
